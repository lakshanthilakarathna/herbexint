## Technical Details

### Date Filtering Logic
```javascript
// Calculates start and end dates based on selected period
const getDateRangeFilter = () => {
  switch (dateRange) {
    case 'today': // Today from 00:00
    case 'week': // Monday to today
    case 'month': // First day of month to today
    case 'year': // January 1st to today
  }
}
```

### Data Aggregation
```javascript
// Product sales aggregation from order items
const productSales = {};
orders.forEach(order => {
  order.items.forEach(item => {
    productSales[item.product_id].revenue += item.total_price;
    productSales[item.product_id].quantity += item.quantity;
  });
});
```

### Stock Status Calculation
```javascript
// Inventory value = sum of (stock_quantity * cost_price)
const totalInventoryValue = products.reduce((sum, p) => 
  sum + (p.stock_quantity * p.cost_price), 0
);
```
