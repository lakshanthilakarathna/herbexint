### 3. localStorage in AuthContext (Needed for Authentication)
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Lines 94-202: Using localStorage for auth tokens
- ✅ This is OKAY - authentication tokens need localStorage

### 4. Comments Mention "DynamoDB"
**Files:**
- `src/pages/Products.tsx` - Multiple comments mention "DynamoDB"
- `src/pages/Customers.tsx` - Comments mention "DynamoDB"
- `src/pages/Orders.tsx` - Comments mention "DynamoDB"

## Fix Required

Replace localStorage with API calls in:
1. `src/pages/Reports.tsx`
2. `src/components/reports/SalesRepPerformance.tsx`

### Update Comments
Remove "DynamoDB" mentions from comments.
