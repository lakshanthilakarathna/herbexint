# ✅ Backend Successfully Created and Tested!

## What Was Done

### 1. Backend Server Created
- ✅ **`backend/server.js`** - Express.js API server
- ✅ **`backend/package.json`** - Dependencies configured
- ✅ Backend is **running locally on port 3001**

### 2. Frontend Updated
- ✅ **`src/services/apiClient.ts`** - Changed from localStorage to HTTP API
- ✅ Automatic URL routing (localhost for dev, /api for production)

### 3. Testing Results
```bash
✅ Health Check: http://localhost:3001/api/health
   Response: {"status":"ok","message":"HERB Backend API is running"}

✅ Products API: http://localhost:3001/api/products
   Response: [] (empty, ready for data)

✅ Customers API: http://localhost:3001/api/customers  
   Response: [] (empty, ready for data)

✅ Orders API: http://localhost:3001/api/orders
   Response: [] (empty, ready for data)
```

## What's Next?

### Option 1: Deploy to EC2 (Recommended)
Follow **`BACKEND_EC2_SETUP.md`** guide to deploy backend to your EC2 instance.

**Quick Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Upload backend to EC2
scp -i ~/Downloads/herbexint.pem -r backend/* ubuntu@ec2-13-41-78-113.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/var/www/herbexint-api/

# 2. SSH into EC2 and install
ssh -i ~/Downloads/herbexint.pem ubuntu@ec2-13-41-78-113.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
cd /var/www/herbexint-api
npm install
pm2 start server.js --name herb-backend
```

### Option 2: Test Locally First
Test your frontend with the local backend running:

1. Make sure backend is running: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Test adding products/customers/orders
