# Fix Applied - Ready to Test

## Problem
Device B was showing error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'color')"

## Cause
1. Test product created via curl API had missing fields
2. Browser was caching old JavaScript files

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Code
✅ Added safety check for undefined category in Products.tsx
✅ Products now default to 'liquor' if category is missing

### 2. Cleaned Data
✅ Removed incomplete test product from backend
✅ Backend now has empty products array (ready for real data)

### 3. Deployed Updated Code
✅ New frontend deployed to EC2
